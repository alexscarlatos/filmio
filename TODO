- separate trimming and patching from -m option
- automatically detect and convert 24 bit wav files
- handle long audio files in Praat (don't rely on first 30 seconds containing match point)
- Praat scores don't seem to be very accurate
- test out patching multiple video and audio files
    - will have to make sure that trimmed files are renamed correctly to not collide
- nice neat executable
