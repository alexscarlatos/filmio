If you're a videographer, filmmaker, or a hobbyist who records their video and audio separately, this is the tool for you! 

Simply provide your source video and audio files, and using the magic of cross-correlation,
the best matches will be found, resulting in copies of your video files with the external audio attached in the right spot.
